# AI-and-ML-Basics
This previously had code from my college course-  but now I have gone ahead and focused more 
on making this my intermediate self study corner. Scientific evaluations are included in these files, 
and I make it a point to encourage self study like this with your own csv files. 

Machine leanring and AI learning was something I got into during my final year of college when my 
Professor created a course dedicated to it. I took notes, and did some of my own observations. And these files are inspired by that.
I will keep this repository as an information forward space and by that I mean I will focus on posting my own scientific analysis.
I enjoy doing deep dives, so don't be confused if I upload things similar to self-guided research projects to practice building things like 
supervised learning models, regression analysis models, or even establishing k-nearest neighbor algorithms to determine predicatblity of any of my future models.
